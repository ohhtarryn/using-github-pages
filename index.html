                        <h3>Relationships First</h3>
                        <p>The first thing I do when joining a company is start building relationships in my first few weeks with coffee chats. Strong relationships enable better collaboration, faster decision-making, and more effective cross-functional work.</p>

                        <h3>Impact vs. Effort</h3>
                        <p>I like a simple impact vs. effort framework and doing these with both design and engineering in the room so we have a good idea of our estimates. This collaborative approach ensures realistic planning and shared ownership.</p>

                        <p>I drive alignment by workshops and facilitation from my design background. Visualizing flows and sketching wires helps people communicate better as well as asking people for their insights.</p>
